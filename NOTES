cd tests;
pytest test_train_bpe.py;

================

pytest test_train_bpe.py::test_train_bpe
pytest test_train_bpe.py::test_train_bpe -s
> this shows print statements we make.

================

read README.md --> shows how they want us to run the code
info not given in pdf.
oh also the command was given on page 9 of the pdf.

================

so what is this path:
/home/brian/Desktop/assignment1-basics/tests/fixtures/corpus.en

oh wait, that is a real file that comes with the git clone ...

================

https://github.com/ZitongYang/cs336-assignment1-basics
https://github.com/ZitongYang/cs336-assignment2-systems
https://github.com/ZitongYang/cs336-assignment3-scaling

https://github.com/eljandoubi/LLM-From-Scratch/blob/main/cs336_basics/train_bpe_tokenizer.py

================

pytest tests/test_train_bpe.py::test_train_bpe_special_tokens -s -vv

================

so we mostly skipped over BPE and tokenization ... which maybe we should go back to.

cs336_basics/__init__.py
> delete the contents of this or else we have issues.

pytest tests/test_model.py::test_linear
pytest tests/test_model.py::test_embedding
pytest tests/test_model.py::test_rmsnorm
pytest tests/test_model.py::test_swiglu
pytest tests/test_model.py::test_rope
pytest tests/test_nn_utils.py::test_softmax_matches_pytorch
pytest tests/test_model.py::test_scaled_dot_product_attention
pytest tests/test_model.py::test_multihead_self_attention

================

we need to return to train bpe and tokenization
so we learn the i/o of the model

pytest tests/test_train_bpe.py::test_train_bpe

================

so the new challenge is we have to merge all the indices
but the indices are at the word level now
so i guess we need to call it like 10 times?

================

pytest tests/test_train_bpe.py::test_train_bpe_speed

================

pytest tests/test_tokenizer.py::test_roundtrip_single_character
pytest tests/test_tokenizer.py::test_roundtrip_single_unicode_character

pytest tests/test_tokenizer.py

> dont do this one
pytest tests/test_tokenizer.py::test_encode_special_token_double_newline_non_whitespace -vv
> do this one instead, I think the problem is the double white space
